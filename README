This is a Python code that solves the travelling salesman problem using ant colony optimisation. The required source code files are:
	travelling_salesman.py
	biggroup.py
	work.py
	graphbit.py
	parameters.py

The code is run by using the command: python -O travelling_salesman.py <number of cities> <city data file> <output file>
The city data file should be in the pickled format
The -O flag turns on optimisation and prevents the code from printing unnecessary output information. This flag can be removed to help with debugging (WARNING: output will be extremely long)

The code parameters can be altered in the file parameters.py. Increasing the number of ants, iterations, or repetitions will increase the accuracy and execution time of the code.

The code can be tested using the command: python -O tests.py
Again, the -O flag can be removed for extra debugging information.
WARNING: The tests may fail if the values in the parameters file have been changed. If this is this case, ensure that there is a file called parameters.py containing the text below before running any tests.

#Default values for parameters.py:
#sets cutoff point: If the number of cities is <= this number then the program will use the _small values.
#                   Otherwise the _big values will be used 
cutoff                  = 10

#_small values
num_ants_small          = 20
num_iterations_small    = 12
num_repetitions_small   = 1

#_big values
num_ants_big	            = 28
num_iterations_big      = 20
num_repetitions_big     = 1
